Test cases in this directory requires `expect'.

The files that start with extension `.test' specify test cases, on for
each line, similar to:

A:A:eve:ev<n><dat>
A:R:eva:ev<n><dat>
G:A:ev<n><dat>:eve
G:R:ev<n><dat>:eva

The first field (separated with colon `:') tells whether test is valid
for analysis (A) or generation (G). The second field instructs whether
the test-expect pair is good and should be accepted (A) or bad and
rejected (R). The third field is the string to test, and the fourth
field is string to expect (or not to expect for R). For a reject test,
if the expect string is not specified, then it means the send string
is not accepted at all and analysis or generation should fail. So, the
second line above is better specified,

A:R:eva:
