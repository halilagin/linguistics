- TODO's marked all around in the source files.
- Derivation -Ik that makes adjectives from verbs.
- Causative forms of verbs ending in -Il needs attention.
- The formation of pronouns by -(s)I to "place adverbials", such as
  içeri, aşağı, öte ...
- The adjectives (or nouns or postpositions) of location 'iç, dış,
  üst, etc.' form complex adjectivals 'insanlık dışı, doğa üstü...'.
  This is similar to what is described as 'postpositional usage' in
  G&K, but it is different than the patterns listed by them. It also
  looks like a noun compound.
- Relate irregular causatives, such as kalk->kaldır to their root forms.
    kalk  -> kaldır
    öğren -> öğret
- Derivational morphemes need review
- Apostrophe insertion does not currently comply with official spelling
  rules.
- <acr> is not analyzed
- Mark auxiliary verbs like ol/bul.
- Mark verbs for transitivity.
- Mark verbs for (typical) cases their indirect objects take.
- Handling of reduplication is less than acceptable. We have a
  lexicon, Redup, with a few non-wrod reduplication pieces, like
  'maşkım'. However, 
        (1) ideally these items should be tokenized together with the
            previous word: e.g., 'aşkım maşkım'
        (2) They should be allowed to inflect (the entry should be
            something like 'aşk maşk<n>').
-   apply up> okuyorsak mı
    ???
- yan- and yak- relation
- Use a more natural lexical representation for compound noun roots.
  Now, we require the -(s)I at the end to be removed, which can be
  done by xfst rules just fine.
- Optional apostrophe choice is buggy, it seems to be always
  compulsory.
- -ken is allowed all all verbal noun suffixes. Not quite correct.
    . gelmişken is ok 
    . geldikken is not
    . gelişken is not
    ....
